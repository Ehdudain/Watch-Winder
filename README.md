# Watch-Winder
Arduino Code for my Watch Winder
This code works alongside my Watch Winder Project. You can find me on YouTube if you are confused about how to assemble everything. 
Since I used an Arduino for the project, my code runs in the Arduino Software. 

*Note: before you mess with these settings, make sure you look at the spreadsheet to know what to change.
Notable settings: 
motorDelay - changes the ms of delay for the stepper motor
cycle - changes the amount of rotations the Watch Winder performs

method rotationCycle() - you can change the break time here (resting time after a complete cycle).
method loop() - You can change the active and resting time for the watch winder here.
